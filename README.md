# ðŸ§  Machine Learning & Data Science Projects Portfolio
Welcome! This repository contains my end-to-end machine learning and data science projects. Each project is designed to demonstrate practical skills, ranging from data analysis and machine learning modeling to cloud-based pipelines.

As a physics student, I focus on projects that blend data science with scientific thinking, including physics-inspired projects alongside classic machine learning tasks.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Categories:
### Regression
- [Power Plant Energy Output Prediction](./regression/power-plant-energy/)

### Classification 
- [Customer Churn Prediction (Planned)](./classification/customer-churn-prediction/)

### Time Series & Signal Processing
- [Exoplanet Detection (Planned)](./time-series/exoplanet-detection/)

### Computer Vision
- [Galaxy Morphology Classification (Planned)](./computer-vision/galaxy-morphology-classification/)

### Physics Simulations + ML
- [N-body Simulation Prediction (Planned)](./physics-simulations/n-body-prediction/)

### Predictive Maintenance 
- [Machine Failure Prediction (Planned)](./predictive-maintenance/machine-failure-prediction/)

## ðŸš€ Goals of This Portfolio
* Demonstrate machine learning and data science skills through practical projects.
